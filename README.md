# ML-Recommended-Resources
From my experience of learning ML, I suggest following resources which can be consulted by Beginners.

A. For python itself, a proper beginner course is necessary.<br> 
     &emsp; 1. [**Python for Beginners** (Coursera)](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python?): First two courses are must for understanding what's going on.<br>
     &emsp; 2. [**Python for Beginner** (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlRFEj9H3Oj7Bp8-DfGpfAfDBiblRfl5p) Watch upto video 47(Course 2), first few beginner videos can be skipped.<br>
     &emsp; 3. [**Python for Everyone**(freeCodeCamp)](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/) Same course as above two, but with free certificate.<br>
     &emsp; 4. [**Python Documentation**](https://www.python.org/doc/): Documentations are highly recommended for all learning purposes. You can consult documentation for specific function at times if you are already familiar with python.<br>
     &ensp; **Blogs can be consulted and for specific questions [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/) can be consulted.**
